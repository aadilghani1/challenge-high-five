## How to run locally?

- Clone the repository
- Install the dependencies `npm i`
- Env is already in sync so you can run `npm run dev` and get started


## Why SSR over CSR?

- Because it helps to pre-render the pages and helps with seo in a way where crawlers are able to understand your content since the webpage is already rendered before reaching the client hence boosting your seo score
- Helps to get all the data but there is an initial load/waiting time(Can be tackled with incremental static side rendering)
